# Getting Started

Install your dependencies

```sh
yarn install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

and if you want to use the docker in development you can do it with:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
