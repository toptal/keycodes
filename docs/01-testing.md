## Generate combined coverage report

You can run manually [coverage workflow through GitHub Actions](https://github.com/toptal/site-acq-project-template/actions/workflows/coverage.yml)

```bash
mkdir test-coverage-all
mv test-coverage/unit/jest-unit-coverage-report/coverage-final.json test-coverage/e2e/coverage-final-unit.json
find test-coverage -type f -name '*.json' -exec cp {} test-coverage-all ';'
mkdir -p test-coverage/temp
yarn nyc merge test-coverage-all test-coverage/temp/coverage-final.json
yarn nyc report --temp-dir test-coverage/temp --reporter html --report-dir test-coverage/coverage-report-all
```

## Visual regression tests

### Happo settings

Go to LastPass and get Happo login credentials, so you can access the dashboard from our account. If donâ€™t have the credentials, reach out to IT Ops channel on Slack.

Add to your global environment variables:

```
HAPPO_API_KEY=XXX
HAPPO_API_SECRET=XXX
```

### Running Happo tests

```bash
yarn install && yarn build
yarn happo run
```

You can compare runs between two commit hashes with:

```bash
yarn happo compare first-commit-hash second-commit-hash
```

You can run by test component with:

```bash
yarn happo run --only component-name
```

Check documentation about [Happo tests best practices](https://toptal-core.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SACQ/pages/2561933682/Happo+tests+best+practices) for more quality driven tests.
