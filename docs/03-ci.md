# CI

The project uses GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration. Inside `.github/workflows`, you will find the following workflows: `lint`, `unit`, `e2e` and `happo`. All workflows are setup to run on Pull Requests and on merge to `master` branch (except `happo`, which is configured initially to run just on PRs).
